# Function Approximation Neural Networks
**Neural networks for multiavariable function approximation & Regression.**
# Introduction
* Neural networks possess the property of universal approximation, which means that given enough parameters, a neural net can approximate any multi-variable continuous function to any desired level of accuracy.
* Many built-in functions in MATLAB only provide functionality for curve fitting (1D) or surface fitting (2D). In contrast, neural networks can handle more general and higher-dimensional fitting problems. 
* Compared to the fitting errors of built-in functions, neural networks can provide astonishing accuracy when it comes to approximating highly complex functions.
